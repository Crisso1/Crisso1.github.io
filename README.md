# Cristian Otalora

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm a geology graduate currently transitioning into the world of technology through a Computer Science degree at the University of Calgary. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between earth sciences and computing—with growing interests in cybersecurity, backend development, and data systems.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently studying Computer Science with a background in field-based research and mineral exploration. My academic and professional journey has taken me from mapping rock formations in the Northwest Territories to building backend systems in Java and exploring the fundamentals of network security.

After earning my degree in geology, I worked in mineral exploration as a Junior Geologist, where I:
- Oversaw small-scale drilling projects
- Contributed to large-scale drilling operations
- Managed core shack operations
- Participated in geological mapping and sampling in remote field environments

These experiences strengthened my ability to work under pressure, lead small teams, and manage large-scale technical datasets.

Now, I’m building skills in:
- Software engineering (Java, Python)
- Database design and management (PostgreSQL, DBeaver)
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (Nmap, Wireshark, network programming)
- Backend development with Spring Boot and socket programming

I'm particularly interested in how secure, data-driven tools can be applied across technical and environmental domains.
